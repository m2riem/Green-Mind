This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# 🌿 Green Mind

**Green Mind** is an interactive educational platform designed to inspire children to love nature and learn about the environment in a fun, playful, and meaningful way.
The website combines games, rewards, environmental lessons, and AI-powered plant recognition to make eco-education engaging and accessible for kids.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The main goal of **Green Mind** is to teach kids eco-friendly habits—such as recycling, planting, and saving resources—using interactive games and activities.
Children earn points and rewards as they progress, allowing them to grow a **virtual tree** that evolves with every achievement.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 👶 Child Experience

* Play interactive environmental games (Puzzle, Memory, Sorting, etc.)
* Earn points and rewards for completing levels
* Grow a **virtual tree** based on accumulated points
* Unlock new lessons and fun educational content
* Upload plant photos for **AI-based plant recognition**

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent Experience

* Create a parent account and manage multiple child profiles
* Track each child’s progress and learning achievements
* Receive notifications and insights about the child’s activity
* View analytics showing performance, strengths, and improvements

### 🤖 AI Feature

Children can upload plant images, and the AI module provides:

* Plant name
* Care instructions
* Watering and sunlight needs
* Fertilizer recommendations

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer    | Technology                                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend | React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript                                      |
| Backend  | Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions)                 |
| AI       | Python (image classification model + REST API)                       |
| Tools    | Firebase Console, VS Code, GitHub, Postman, Figma, Adobe Illustrator |

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Parents** create an account using Firebase Authentication.
2. They add one or more **child profiles** stored in Firestore.
3. **Children** start playing educational games and earn points.
4. Points help grow the **virtual tree** and unlock new lessons.
5. Children upload plant images → stored in Firebase Storage.
6. Firebase Cloud Functions send the image URL to the **Python AI API**.
7. The AI returns plant info → saved in Firestore → displayed to the child.
8. **Parents** monitor progress through their dashboard.

## 🎨 UI & UX Design

* Bright, colorful, kid-friendly interface suitable for ages 6–12
* Simple and intuitive navigation
* Rounded shapes, animations, and rewards for engagement
* Parent dashboard designed with clean layouts and easy-to-read analytics
* Tools used: **Figma**, Adobe Illustrator, Canva

Screens included:

* Home Page
* Games Dashboard
* Virtual Tree
* Lessons Page
* AI Plant Analyzer
* Parent Dashboard
